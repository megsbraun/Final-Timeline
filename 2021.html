                In the wake of the 2020 pandemic, and still grappling with its socioeconomic fallout, Extension fully
embraces an “Online First” strategy with the objective of creating better access to learners in the San
Francisco Bay area as well as across the U.S. and around the globe. By assuming its role as global
representative of the university for study away and study abroad partnerships, Extension is also
investing in institutional partnerships to build meaningful study pathways within the U.S. and
internationally. Finally, to provide more access to college, Extension plans to develop Pre-Collegiate
and K-12 offerings with defined pathways into partner colleges.
